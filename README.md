# What is this?
This is a repository where I am testing multiple methods of simulating an artificial brain, all the different end products will end up in separate branches, the main branch will be the most recent attempt.

# Why this tho?
Because idk, it all started with a stupid idea of how our contiousness started out which progressed into a proof of concept in attempt 0 written in python,
when I saw it was "working" I thought why not add some graphics and visuals to see what the network was doing,
and that ended up as attempt 1 written in C++ (this attempt was also producing what one would call a constant seizure, forcing neurons to not end up on a constant state, mostly for the visuals).

# What's the current attempt?
The current attempt is all about creating some form of visuals using the baseline of attempt 0.

# Attempt 0
This attempt was a proof of concept trying to achieve some sort of circular signal within the "brain".
