# What is this?
This is a repository where I am testing multiple methods of simulating an artificial brain, all the different end products will end up in separate branches, the main branch will be the most recent attempt.

# Why this tho?
Because idk, it all started with a stupid idea of how our contiousness started out which progressed into a proof of concept in attempt 0 written in python.

# What's the current attempt?
The current attempt is a proof of concept trying to achieve some sort of circular signal within the "brain".
